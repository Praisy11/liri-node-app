In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

#LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

concert-this

spotify-this-song

movie-this

do-what-it-says
##What Each Command Should Do
node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>

This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API ("https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + Cher + "/events?app_id=codingbootcamp") for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

Name of the venue

Venue location

Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'

This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

Artist(s)

The song's name

A preview link of the song from Spotify

The album that the song is from

If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.
